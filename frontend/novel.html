                  <p>Pride and Prejudice is a romantic novel of manners written by Jane Austen in 1813. The novel follows
                    the character development of Elizabeth Bennet, the dynamic protagonist of the book who learns about the
                    repercussions of hasty judgments and comes to appreciate the difference between superficial goodness and actual
                    goodness. Its humour lies in its honest depiction of manners, education, marriage, and money during the Regency
                    era in Great Britain.<br>
