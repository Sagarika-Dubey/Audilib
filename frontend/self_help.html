                  <p>Changing your mindset can make you successful. Have you ever looked at a successful person and
                    thought, “How do they do it?” When we look at people who appear to have their lives together, who seem to
                    succeed at everything they do, it's easy to assume that success must be a trait that some people have and some
                    people don't. But How Successful People Think (2009) proves that success is a mindset, not a personality trait.<br>

                    purpose. Ikigai is similar to the French term “raison d'etre” or “reason for being.”<br>
