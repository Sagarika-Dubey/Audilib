                  <p>Bill Nye was a famous American humor columnist in the middle 1800's. And he did exactly that in hundreds of newspaper columns
                    that were later collected into books. This is a selection of just 35 of the most humorous, wry and downright
                    funny cogitations of his, written of course in the somewhat convoluted style common in the 19th century which
                    just adds to their flavor in my opinion.<br>

                  <p>The Best American Humorous Short Stories features tales from Oliver Wendell Holmes, Edgar Allan Poe,
                    Mark Twain and many other well known writers. From the editor: This volume does not aim to contain all the best
                    American humorous short stories; there are many other stories equally as good, I suppose, in much the same vein,
                    scattered through the range of American literature. <br>
